== BRICK PRESS ==

This is a tool for building static files (such as sass) and concatenating
and compressing them into one file.

The input is a blank-line separated list of files that should be built
(and possibly minified) returns a list of urls corresponding to where
the built group is now served. Here is a made-up example:

INPUT:

/project/a.coffee
/project/b.coffee
/project/a.js
/project/c.coffee

/project/sass_lib
/project/a.scss
/project/b.scss
/project/c.css

OUTPUT:

http://localhost:8080/js/1.js
http://localhost:8080/css/1.css

So each group of paths in the input correspond to a single url in the output.
Note that for sass files the line may be a directory path, in the case
where a library is needed to compile the scss file.
